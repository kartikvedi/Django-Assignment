# OckyPocky Assessment

### Python/Django Development Internship

Please do the assignment using the Django framework in python.
Create a Website Login flow using Authentication.

- Create the Rest api for the User Sign up , Login , update password, forgot, reset password.
- Develop a single responsive webpage.
  P.S. You can use any frontend library / framework.


## Appendix

I have developed this cluster of API using Django-Rest-Framework. All endpoints are designed in
an authenticaed manner so as the user is unable to jump pages without gaining required/proper
pre-requisite.\
\
This API is using built-in Django's authentication methods for example login, logout, etc.
Updating password or reseting password is all done using Django's built forms so as to follow DRY _(Don't Repeat Yourself)_ code.
\
\
Each view is protected with a `login_required` decorator so that the view cannot be triggered without having permissions.

P.S - This project this using `dotenv` package inorder to project sensitive keys. I am sending you the .env file attached with the repository in order to use SMTP services.
